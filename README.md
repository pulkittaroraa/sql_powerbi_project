# Data-Driven Pricing Strategy for Joe's Bike Shop

## Objective

Develop a comprehensive dashboard for Joe's Bike Shop to display key performance metrics and facilitate informed decision-making.

## Problem Statement

Joe's Bike Shop requires a dynamic dashboard to track and analyze:

- Hourly Revenue Analysis
- Profit and Revenue Trends
- Seasonal Revenue
- Rider Demographics

Additionally, the project aims to provide recommendations for potential price adjustments for the upcoming year based on the analysis.

## Data Provided

- Sales data for Joe's Bike Shop from 2021 and 2022
- Cost of goods sold (COGS) data

## Analysis Workflow

1. **Database Creation**: Consolidated the sales data into a single database using SQL.
2. **SQL Query Development**: Developed SQL queries to extract and calculate necessary metrics.
3. **Power BI Integration**: Connected Power BI to the SQL database to visualize the data.
4. **Dashboard Development**: Created an interactive and informative dashboard in Power BI.
5. **Recommendation Formulation**: Analyzed data trends to provide recommendations on price adjustments.

## Conclusion

### Recommendation

**Conservative Increase**: Given the substantial revenue growth last year, a conservative price increase of 10-15% is suggested to test market response without risking a significant drop in demand.

- If the 2022 price was $4.99, a 10% increase would raise it to approximately $5.49.
- A 15% increase would set the price around $5.74.

### Price Setting Strategy

- **Market Analysis**: Conduct further market research to gauge customer satisfaction and competitive landscape.
- **Segmented Pricing Strategy**: Consider different pricing for casual and registered users based on their price sensitivity.
- **Monitor and Adjust**: Implement the new prices and closely monitor customer feedback and sales data. Be ready to adjust the pricing strategy as needed.
